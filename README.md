# AI-Powered Financial Analyst Assistant

This project is a modular AI system that uses multiple LLM-powered agents to automate key tasks in financial analysis. It leverages Prompt Engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Agent-based orchestration to generate insightful, accurate, and structured answers from stock data, company filings, financial news, and finance concepts.

## Project Goals

Traditional financial analysis can be time-consuming and technically challenging. Analysts spend hours digging through earnings reports, filings, and news â€” often without strong programming experience. This project mitigates that challenge by:

- Automating financial data extraction
- Providing natural language access to financial databases and documents
- Summarizing and synthesizing complex information across multiple sources
- Empowering analysts using LLMs with memory and reasoning abilities

## System Architecture

The system uses the LangGraph framework to orchestrate AI agents:

- **Router Agent (GPT-3.5)**: Classifies the user query into `stock`, `filing`, `news`, or `concept`
- **Stock Agent (Mistral)**: Generates SQL to query financial stock data
- **Filing Agent (Claude Opus)**: Performs RAG over 10-K/10-Q PDFs using FAISS
- **Concept Agent (Claude Opus)**: Explains financial concepts like DCF, ROE, etc.
- **Synthesis Agent (GPT-4)**: Synthesizes insights from the above agents into one final response
